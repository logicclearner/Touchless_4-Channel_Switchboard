# Touchless_4-Channel_Switchboard
This project is an Arduino-based touchless switchboard that uses four HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to independently control four relays. It allows a user to toggle connected devices on or off by waving a hand in front of a sensor, providing a modern and hygienic alternative to a physical switch panel.
